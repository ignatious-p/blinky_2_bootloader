I am using an [STM32 Smart V2.0](https://stm32-base.org/boards/STM32F103C8T6-STM32-Smart-V2.0) board with a JLink debugger for this course.

A (quick) rundown of the specs of the microcontroller:
- Arm® 32-bit [Cortex®-M3](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0337/h/?lang=en) processor (72MHz max)
    -  ARMv7-M architecture
- 64 Kbytes of flash memory
- 20 Kbytes of SRAM

I have included the datasheets for the STM32 microcontroller as well as the Technical Reference Manual for the Cortex®-M3 processor.
